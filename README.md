# **Project One: Funky Fishing**

### 1. Game Description
My game will be a Go Fish/Fishing Tycoon style game where the player character is at the top of the screen in a boat with a fishing rod. Upon the start of the game, the fishing lure will drop at a specified speed towards the bottom of the screen which will be a view of an ocean scene. Fish of varying size (and other objects) will be passing across the screen at different intervals and directions, horizontally. The player will need to sweep across the screen to catch fish. There will be a point system and hazards in the game.

### 2. Game Tech
I will be using basic HTML5 Canvas, HTML 5, CSS and Javascript to implement the Funky Fish game board and game logic.

### 3. Minimal Viable Product
My MVP will be a static canvas with boxes (/'fish') moving across the screen horizontally at varying intervals. The game will have a casting button to start the fishing and the player will have to catch as many boxes/fish as the fishing pole reals back in at a specified speed, each catch with a specified number of points. If a player hits or catches a hazard (shark), the player will lose points until they lose/die from a hazard. Winning state will be some form of standard in points or timing.

## 4. STRETCH GOALZ BABEEE
### + My highest priority for SGs is to make the game visually apealling to the user. I think this important since styling is somethig I find challenging and I want to practice as much as I can.
### + Next I would like to add a moving frame over a larger canvas in a flappy bird style where the board moves rather than the player who will move only side to side.
### + If I have time I would like to make this game mobil friendly
### + If by some miracle I actually get all of that done I would want to add some fun features like more hazards (i.e. trash, clothes, odd objects that help or hinder the player).
